Directory containing the results of the threshold tuning scan for VCASN registers for each stave. Files are named 'L<layer number>_<stave number>'.yml, e.g. L5_42.yml. Each file has the extended chipid on the left and the vcasn VALUE on the right. Files are generated by using plot_tune.py on the decoded results of a threshold scan.
